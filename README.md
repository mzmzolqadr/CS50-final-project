# CS50-final-project

In this project I have made a Personal library for my books. I used CS50 ide and flask for this projects.

I used the cs50 finance problem set and then I have changed some of the functions and ideas of that cs50 finance to my own project. 
For example i have some new functions like :
1- newbook for adding a new book to my library,
2- registering page for new admins,
3- searching among books,
4- removing a book from my library and so on.

this project has been made by flask framework, let me know if you wnat to see the website itself and I can run it for you.
